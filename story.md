🕵️‍♂️ Title: The Smoke Under Harbour Street
🎬 Act I: The Disappearance

    Hook: You’re hired by Vivienne Sinclair, a jazz singer at the “Blue Violet Club,” to find Lorne Maddox — her ex-lover and a smuggler with dangerous connections — who vanished two nights ago.

    Initial Leads:

        A cufflink left in Vivienne’s dressing room.

        Rumors of a shipment gone wrong.

        The police, led by Leone, claim no knowledge — but are clearly hiding something.

🔥 Act II: Digging Up Trouble

    Key Locations Open Up:

        The Club backroom (accessible with a stolen key)

        A train station locker

        The alley behind the club

        Mick’s Garage (fixer and ex-cop with ties to smuggling)

    Discoveries:

        Lorne was working both sides — playing Leone and the smugglers.

        A ledger details payoff routes and false identities.

        You learn Vivienne may be hiding more than she says.

    Escalation:

        Leone’s men begin tailing you.

        Mick warns you to back off — someone’s setting you up.

⚖️ Act III: The Truth Cuts Deep

    Major Reveal:

        Vivienne set Lorne up to protect herself.

        The shipment is people, not goods — human trafficking.

        Lorne was trying to blow the whistle before disappearing.

    Confrontation Possibilities:

        Confront Vivienne → She confesses, begs for silence.

        Confront Leone → He tries to kill you or bribe you.

        Work with Mick → He helps expose the ring or betray you, depending on trust built.

🧯 Act IV: Endgame

    Possible Endings (based on player flags):

        📢 Expose the truth: Release the ledger to the press. Vivienne vanishes, Leone is arrested.

        💔 Take the fall: You're framed. The real culprits walk.

        🥀 Walk away: Burn the evidence. Keep your life, lose your soul.

        🔥 Revenge: Kill Leone or Vivienne. A brutal finale.

Scenes:

🕯️ Scene 1: The Client Walks In

Setting: Your detective office. Dim light, rain tapping the window, smoke curling from your half-burned cigarette.

Objective: Introduce the mystery and characters.
📌 Key Elements:

    Vivienne Sinclair arrives, distraught but guarded.

    She wants you to find Ray Callahan, her ex-lover.

    She insists the police won’t help.

    Leaves behind a cufflink and an envelope of cash.

    Hints at Ray’s secrets: “He was into something bad. And scared.”

Game Mechanics Introduced:

    Dialogue choice tree (trust vs pressure)

    Inventory item: Ray's Cufflink

    Flag: case_started

🧩 Optional Variation:

    If the player pushes too hard, Vivienne may withhold information, requiring persuasion or proof later to reopen her trust.

    If the player comforts her or acts professional, she hints at Leone’s involvement subtly.

🌧️ Scene 2: The Rain-Slicked Streets of Harbour Street

Setting: Night. You step out of your office and into the rain-soaked streets. Neon flickers. A car idles too long near a corner. Somewhere, a saxophone plays.
📌 Key Elements:

    Hub Location: This scene introduces the explorable map (north: station, east: Blue Violet Club, west: alley, south: back to office).

    You might meet a bystander or shady informant lingering in the alley (optional encounter).

    A newspaper vendor yells about “smugglers on the waterfront” — ambient worldbuilding.

🔍 Optional Discoveries:

    Suspicious Figure watching from a parked car (Leone’s men, perhaps).

    A discarded matchbook with the Blue Violet logo (reinforces club lead if missed earlier).

    First puzzle (locked gate) leading to the alley shortcut.

🧩 Mechanics Introduced:

    Basic navigation (N/E/S/W) between areas.

    Optional interactions with minor NPCs.

    Environmental clues.

    Flag: explored_streets

✅ Flow Update So Far:

    Scene 1: Detective Office — Vivienne hires you.

    Scene 2: Harbour Street — World opens up, noir flavor, hints of danger.

    Scene 3: Blue Violet Club — Vivienne’s haunt.

🎷 Scene 3: The Blue Violet Club — Vivienne’s Territory

Setting: A moody jazz club bathed in low crimson light. Red velvet curtains. A saxophone player croons on stage. The air is thick with smoke and suspicion.
🧍‍♀️ Key NPC:

    Vivienne Sinclair is here, mid-song or sipping something strong at the bar.

    Depending on how you handled Scene 1, she’ll greet you coldly or with wary warmth.

🧩 Core Interactions:

    Show her Ray's Cufflink (if you kept it).

    Ask about Ray → unlocks deeper dialogue only if you build trust or present a clue.

    Try to access the backroom (blocked unless she gives permission or you sneak in later).

    Learn about Mick ("Ask him about the shipment. He knows more than he lets on.")

🎭 Dialogue Variations (Based on Flags):

    If case_started but no cufflink shown → “Why are you here?”

    If cufflink_found → unlock dialogue branch where she warns: “Ray was in too deep.”

    If you pressure too hard → she shuts you down. You’ll need to regain trust through another NPC.

🧠 Player Options:

    Convince her to talk (via dialogue choices)

    Lie and say Ray’s in trouble (risky)

    Leave and follow another lead (alley or Mick’s garage)

🧩 Mechanics:

    Flag: vivienne_met

    Dialogue branches

    Puzzle: Access to the backroom (requires persuasion or a key later)

🔓 Unlocks:

    The back alley behind the club (used in Scene 4 or 5)

    Hint to visit Mick’s Garage

    The idea that Ray was involved with “a shipment” — the deeper mystery.

🌒 Scene 4: The Back Alley — Smoke, Footsteps, Blood

Setting: A narrow alley behind the Blue Violet Club. Fire escapes climb up the walls like ribs. The dumpster stinks of rot and rain. Broken glass and an old poster for a boxing match peel off the brick.
🧩 Purpose:

    This scene deepens the mystery and tension.

    Optional but crucial for players who explore.

    Can lead to new clues, danger, or items depending on timing.

🔍 Key Interactions:
1. Clue: Bloodstain

    A faint blood trail leads toward a fire escape ladder.

    Examining it sets the flag: found_blood_trail

    If followed: leads to Ray’s torn jacket snagged on the ladder → unlocks flag found_jacket

2. Dumpster Discovery

    Succeeding a perception check (or just inspecting) reveals:

        Crushed cigarette pack with initials “L.C.” (Leone’s brand)

        Optional: a matchbook with a locker number and station name (“Grand Central West – #413”)

3. Eavesdropping Event (If visiting at night)

    Player can overhear Leone’s men meeting with a club staffer.

    Choices:

        Confront → triggers a chase or fight.

        Hide → overhear critical info: “He got the ledger out. Mick’s gonna be a problem.”

        Leave silently → safety, but no info gained.

🧩 Mechanics:

    Flag: found_jacket

    Optional item: Station Locker Key (in jacket or dropped nearby)

    Optional branching: back entrance to the club (locked unless backdoor key obtained or force used)

🎯 Outcomes:

    Confirms Ray was at the club recently — and left injured.

    Introduces the concept of the ledger — a central MacGuffin.

    Connects Leone, the club, and Ray more explicitly.

🚉 Scene 5: Train Station — Locker #413

Setting: Grand Central West. The smell of oil, old paper, and people always in a rush. Announcements echo off the stone arches. Pigeons clatter above the rafters. A long corridor leads to the lockers: metal, numbered, and humming with old secrets.
🔐 Getting to the Locker
Access Requirements:

    You must have:

        Flag: found_jacket or item: station_locker_key

        Or you can pick the lock (skill/puzzle)

        Optional: Talk to the janitor to get a master key (requires persuasion)

📦 What’s Inside Locker #413?

You slide open the cold metal door.

Inside:

    A small leather-bound ledger, water-damaged but legible.

    A half-used revolver (optional item).

    A folded piece of paper: “If anything happens to me, Mick will know why.”

📓 The Ledger:

    Pages contain:

        Shipment codes

        Names: Ray Callahan, Leone Cardoza, Mick Dolan

        Payments traced through front businesses (Blue Violet Club, a warehouse by the docks)

        One page circled: "Drop date moved. Too risky. Will handle it myself."

    This unlocks a major flag: ledger_found

    Also updates: ray_was_closing_in_on_leone

🧩 Optional Interactions:

    Suspicious figure watches you from the shadows. If followed, leads to an ambush or chase.

    Janitor may mention someone else accessing the locker earlier in the week — “Real nervous. Had a limp.”

    Security cameras? Maybe they work (player can check records if they find a bribe/police contact later).

🧠 Player Progress:

    Now knows Ray was trying to blow the whistle.

    Has the ledger: a major clue (can be shown to Mick or Vivienne later).

    Connection to Leone and the docks is solid.

🎯 Unlocked Leads:

    Mick Dolan’s Garage (next major scene)

    Warehouse District (Docks) — future area (locked until more info gathered)

🔧 Scene 6: Mick’s Garage — Grease, Guilt, and Gunpowder

Setting: A grimy repair shop on the industrial edge of the city. A rusted chain-link gate swings open with a groan. Inside, the fluorescent lights buzz. The garage smells like oil, old steel, and cold sweat. Tools hang like weapons on the wall.
🧍 Key NPC:

    Mick Dolan: Ray's old friend. Grease-stained overalls. A nervous twitch. Doesn’t like cops or questions. But he liked Ray… and hates Leone.

🧩 Player Goals:

    Confirm Ray’s connection to the ledger and the shipment

    Learn what “the drop” was

    Ask Mick for help (tech skill, tool use, breaking into the docks later)

🔩 Optional Events:

    Inventory update (tools for solving physical puzzles)

    Lore about the arms shipment and how deep the corruption runs

🏭 Scene 7: Warehouse District — The Shipment

Setting: An industrial zone near the harbor. Long, low buildings squat under flickering floodlights. It smells of salt, diesel, and secrets. Chain-link fences topped with razor wire. Freight crates stacked like coffins. A guard booth hums in the distance.
🎯 Purpose:

This is the high-risk, high-reward location. The player’s goal here is to:

    Confirm the illegal shipment of weapons

    Find evidence implicating Leone

    Possibly encounter a traitor or spy

    Escalate the danger and urgency of the plot

🔐 Entry Points:

    Front gate (locked) — requires lockpicking or distracting the guard

    Sewer grate — hidden behind crates (findable with exploration or perception)

    Roof access — if player got tools or help from Mick (e.g. grappling hook, crowbar)

📦 Inside the Warehouse:
🔍 Investigation Zones:

    Shipping Manifest Crate

        Locked in a desk drawer

        Flag: shipment_confirmed

        Optional item: photographic evidence (if player has camera or later visits a reporter)

    Hidden Locker

        Requires searching a back room

        Contains: a bloody rag, and Ray’s lighter

        Flag: ray_was_here

👥 Optional Encounter:
❗ Guard or Inside Man

    Leone’s man, named Connor, discovers the player

    Dialogue options:

        Bribe him (requires cash)

        Threaten him (requires weapon or bluff)

        Persuade him (if you helped Mick or have ledger flag)

If persuaded:

    “They killed him, you know. Ray. Right here. He was trying to get those photos out. That’s when Cardoza snapped.”

This reveals:

    Ray died here

    Leone knows you’re digging

    A final confrontation is inevitable

🧩 Puzzle Opportunity:

    Disarming a timed lock on a crate (small logic puzzle)

    Optional stealth escape if guards enter the warehouse (flag: alarm_triggered)

🧠 Outcomes:

    Major plot advance: Leone’s guilt confirmed

    Emotional weight: Ray’s last moments become personal

    Gameplay: player gains evidence for future confrontation

📍 Leads Opened:

    Final confrontation planning

    Talk to Vivienne again

    Optional: Visit a newspaper editor or police contact

    Prepares for Scene 8: Leone’s Estate — The Lion in His Den

🦁 Scene 8: Leone’s Estate — The Lion in His Den

Setting: A looming mansion perched on the cliffs above the city. Art deco meets fortress. Marble floors, dark wood paneling, heavy shadows. The estate is guarded but not invincible — Leone believes himself untouchable. Jazz plays softly from somewhere inside, warped by distance and menace.
🎯 Purpose:

This is the climactic confrontation. Everything the player has gathered — evidence, allies, items — comes into play here. The outcome of the story branches based on prior decisions.
🛤️ Entry Options:

    Front gate: Requires bluffing or disguise (Vivienne’s dress jacket, if she helps)

    Back entrance: Unlocked if player scouted a route via Mick or warehouse flags

    Roof or cellar: Optional tool use (grappling hook, crowbar, fuse cutter)

🗣️ Key NPC: Leone Cardoza

    Cold, calculating, always five steps ahead

    Tries to talk you down before resorting to violence

🧩 Final Puzzle / Conflict Paths:
1. Social Duel:

If the player brings all evidence flags (shipment + ledger + locker + guard testimony), they can attempt to:

    Exposé Leone (requires flag: leone_directly_tied)

    Blackmail him (requires photo or manifest)

    Convince Vivienne to speak (if her trust was earned)

2. Physical Confrontation:

If dialogue fails or Leone feels cornered:

    He draws a hidden weapon

    The player may:

        Fight (if armed or brought Mick)

        Flee (requires exit knowledge — sewer, back gate)

        Be rescued (Vivienne or Mick intervenes, depending on trust flags)

3. Trap Variant:

If the player arrived recklessly (missing key clues), Leone may:

    Spring a trap (flag: alarm_triggered or no_allies)

    The player wakes up in a basement cell (alternate ending route)

🎭 Endgame Branches (Examples):
🟢 Justice Served:

    Player delivers evidence to the police or the press

    Leone is arrested or exposed

    Vivienne leaves town, freed from his control

    Ray’s death is avenged

🟡 Pyrrhic Victory:

    Leone dies in a fight

    But so does Mick, or the player gets wounded

    The city barely notices — corruption lingers

🔴 Corruption Wins:

    Player fails to gather proof

    Leone buys their silence… or ends the story with a bullet
