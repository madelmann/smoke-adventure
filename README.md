The Smoke Under Harbour Street - A ChatGTP Text Adventure

This project is somewhat of a test to see if I'm able to implement a text adventure with the help of ChatGPT
in my own Slang programming language. The goal for this project is to have a working prototype that can be
extended only by creating more data, which means creating a working system that then can be used by anyone.

Potential goals for the future:
- build a save system (idea: create a basic set of data and instead of modifying this data store the
  modifications elsewhere to easily being able to start from the beginning)
- build an online version of the game where multiple sessions can run simultanously without interacting
  with each other
- implement display of background graphics in the online version
- implement a sophisticated parser that's able to understand synonyms and natural language
